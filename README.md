# AbilityRealizer

Name is very temporary.

## What It Currently Does

Provide support for modding the ability tree and abilities without requiring modders to completely redo all of the PilotDefs, as well as providing a mechanism for updating pilots that are already stored in saves.

* Keeps all pilots/pilot defs up-to-date with the current state of the ability tree (stored in SimGameConstants)

* Prevent crashes/save game loss from changing the ability tree

* Changes the barracks UI to show tooltips for passive abilities that are not primary abilities

## Future Plans

* Provide some sort of mechanism for allowing AI pilots to use active abilities that have been modded in

* Update all save information to remove/update effects from abilities that have been removed/updated (low prio)
